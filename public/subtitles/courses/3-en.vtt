00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yes, copywriting. But what is copywriting exactly?

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Is it more of an art or a science? And what are the tools,

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
techniques and formulas you'll need to know to really

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
